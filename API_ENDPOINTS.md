# StandUp API Endpoints Documentation

## Overview
This document describes all the available API endpoints for the StandUp application. The API follows RESTful principles and uses JWT authentication.

## Base URL
- **Development**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
- **Production**: Configure via environment variables

## Authentication
All endpoints (except `/auth/login`) require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request (validation error)
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)

## Rate Limiting

Currently, no rate limiting is implemented. Consider implementing rate limiting for production use.

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using `skip` and `limit` query parameters:
- `skip`: Number of items to skip (default: 0)
- `limit`: Maximum number of items to return (default: 100, max: 1000)

## Examples

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "New Team",
    "description": "A new team for testing",
    "company_id": 1
  }'
```

### Adding a Member to a Team

  }'
```

### Creating a Ceremony

## Testing

You can test the API using:
1. **Swagger UI**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`
2. **cURL commands**: Use the examples above
3. **Frontend application**: The Angular frontend uses these endpoints

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Response caching
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- File upload handling for ceremony responses
- Advanced scheduling with timezone support
- Email notifications
- Chat integrations (Slack, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams)
